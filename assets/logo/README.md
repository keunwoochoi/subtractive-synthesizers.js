# assets/logo — derived brand assets

Everything in this directory, plus `apps/playground/favicon-pixel.svg`, is
**generated**. Never edit any of it by hand; regenerate with:

```sh
scripts/dev/render-logo.sh   # needs librsvg (rsvg-convert) + ImageMagick
```

## Derivation chain

```
apps/playground/favicon.svg          the source mark (hand-drawn vector; the only input)
        │
        ▼  scripts/dev/gen-logo-mosaic.py
assets/logo/logo.svg                 square-tile mosaic (rounded tiles + grout)
apps/playground/favicon-pixel.svg    the same tile grid as hard pixel art (what the tab shows)
        │
        ▼  rsvg-convert (in render-logo.sh)
assets/logo/logo-{1024,512,256,128}.png

## Design intent (owner-approved, 2026-07-30)

- One visual system across the sets-of-instruments repos: a shared dark plate,
  one glyph and one metallic finish per synth family — `[-]` in steel blue
  here, the amber feather in physical-instruments.js; future families follow
  the same bracket-glyph scheme (e.g. `[+]` for additive).
- The **logo** is a coarse mosaic of rounded tiles with grout gaps, every tile
  snapped to a small fixed palette so it reads as deliberate pixel art.
- The **favicon** is *not* the mosaic shrunk — grout muddies the mark at tab
  sizes. It is the same tile grid rendered as full-bleed hard pixels, so the
  tab icon and the logo are the same artwork at different fidelities.
- The `[-]` tile pattern is mirror-symmetric both ways **by construction**
  (canonical-quadrant sampling), not by sampling luck.

All tunables (grid size, fit scale, palette, symmetry handling) live as named
constants in `scripts/dev/gen-logo-mosaic.py` — that script owns those facts.
The full design journey, including abandoned routes and the measurements that
drove each decision, is in the `git log` of this directory and the journey
log issue.
