// Run the README's quickstart, verbatim, against the packed and installed package.
//
// Release-standard area F: "a quickstart that is EXECUTED rather than written — a
// copy-pasteable snippet nobody has run is a bug report waiting." Everything that makes
// a quickstart wrong is invisible to every other gate in this repo:
//
//   - an import path that does not exist in the "exports" map
//   - a function renamed since the README was written
//   - a preset id that is no longer in the bank
//   - a snippet that only works because the author had a bundler or a dev server
//
// The README block is GENERATED from examples/quickstart.js (see scripts/gen_docs.py),
// so the file executed here and the text a reader copies cannot drift apart.
//
// This deliberately uses a LIVE AudioContext, not an OfflineAudioContext. The quickstart
// calls `createEngine()` with no arguments, which is the path a real user takes and the
// only path that exercises the default context, the default WASM URL and the Blob-URL
// worklet together. install-check.mjs already covers the offline path.
//
