Publishing is behind an authority gate (CLAUDE.md) and this script will not cross it.
When a human decides to release, these are the steps:

  1. set the final version        npm version --no-git-tag-version --prefix packages/core <x.y.z>
  2. move Unreleased into it      \$EDITOR CHANGELOG.md
  3. re-run this check            scripts/release/check-release-ready.sh --full
  4. commit                       git commit -am "chore(release): v<x.y.z>"
  5. tag                          git tag -a v<x.y.z> -m "v<x.y.z>"
  6. push                         git push && git push --tags
  7. publish                      npm publish --access public ./packages/core
  8. GitHub release               scripts/gh-owner.sh release create v<x.y.z> --notes-file CHANGELOG.md

Step 7 is irreversible: npm does not allow a version to be republished, and unpublishing
is restricted. Step 3 is what makes step 7 safe.
